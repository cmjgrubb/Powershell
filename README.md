# Powershell
Just some Powershell scripts to help with system administration

The delete-folders-from-user-desktops.ps1 script deletes files from a user's desktop.

The 'Delinquent Email Script.ps1' reads information from an Excel file called 'Delinquent Notices Test File.xlsx' and sends an E-mail based on that information.

The munisapp-cleanup.ps1 cleans up temporary files from our munisapp server. I created this in version 11.3. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS SCRIPT! IT DELETES STUFF!

The copyDbexport.ps1 copies our database backup and adds the date to the filename.

The microsoftUpdate.ps1 runs Microsoft Update, including Sharepoint updates.

The veeamInstallationPrep.ps1 prepares a non-domain computer to back up to Veeam Backup and Replication.
